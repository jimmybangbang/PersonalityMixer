The purpose of creation of the project is mainly due to our information like, phone number, hobby, purchase likelyhood... are recorded by big data, most importantly, not asking for permissonnn from ourselves. So, since we can't ask them to behave, why not create a mass.
Eg,if I am using Ipad Pro to search drones, service provider will think I am rich, so offer a higher price. If I used a low end phone to search coupon everyday, they will think I am poor, so offer a lower price, at least no price discremnation.
How to do it ?
Step 1 : build a hardware box with smart camera and digit finger
Step 2 : use AI to record operarion behaviors
Step 3 : Connect both and let it run automatialy, target is like Ebay,Amazon ,Tao Bao and Jin dong
Final goal : the service provide only knows a oposite me.
